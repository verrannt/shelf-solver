# Pseudocode of task 1

function assign_correct_rows(state):

        Step A. First assign rows to most prominent color occurences.
        
        for each row in the shelf:
            count no. of occurences of every color in this row and 
            collect the most prominent one
            
            if there is only one most prominent color:
                if this color does not yet have an assigned row:
                    assign this row as correct row for this color
                else if this color already has an assigned row:
                    assign 'None' to this row
            if there are more than one:
                assign 'None' to this row
            
            
        Step B. For the leftover colors assign them randomly.
        
        get the rows that were assigned 'None'
        get the colors that do not have a correct row yet
        for each of the leftover colors:
            randomly assign it to one of the rows
        
        return the correct row assignments

function solve(start_state):
        
        get the row assignments from the assign_correct_rows function
        create an empty stack
        push the start state to the stack
                
        while the stack is not empty:
            
            take the last element from the stack
            
            if the state is a final state:
                return the depth of that state
                
            else compute the children of that state:
            
                for each item in the state:

                    if it is an empty space:
                        continue to next loop

                    if it is in the correct row:
                        continue to next loop

                    else if it is not empty and in the wrong row:
                        
                        compute all possible child states that put the item
                        into the correct row by finding the empty spaces in
                        the correct row
                        
                        for each of the possible child states:
                            if the child state has not been visited:
                                push the child state to the stack

        calculate score of the current state
